        <h3>Living in Fear</h3>
        <p>As humans, we pride ourselves in our abilities to think quickly on our feet and prevail using our brains and wites rather than claws and talons, and this helped us gained dominance as we transitioned from hunter-gatherers to establishing cities. However, there has been one killer that has endured for as long as we have: disease.</p>
        <p>Plasmodium causes malaria. It is a parasite carried among mosquitos that is not only prevalent, but resistant to methods to eradicate it. As such, it is a persistent issue that has yet to be solved even in the modern day</p>

        <h3>Introducing: Genetic Modification</h3>
        <p>A new push to eradicate Malaria is founded on the principle of genetically modifying mosquitos such that mosquitos bearing Plasmodium are unable to sucessfully reproduce. The idea is that female offspring die off while male offspring survive and carry the modified gene. This method would prevent mosquito reproduction in the long run by targeting the female mosquito poplation. By targeting the host rather than the resistant microorganism, there is a higher chance of success.</p>
        <p>It must be noted that some methods of fighting off mosquitos are working, such as having mosquito nets in homes. However, such methods are not totally effective, as the graph above shows that although Malaria deaths have decreased, they are still high.</p>
