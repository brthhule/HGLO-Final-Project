        <h3>Foreign Oil Dependency</h3>
        <p>As long as there have been machines, there has been a need for oil to lubricate their parts. You can not have machines without oil, but to fight wars, you need a lot of machines. And you need a lot of oil</p>
        <p>Although the United States endured a period of isolationism going into World War 2, the global war as well as the emergence of the Soviet state made it apparent that the U.S. could sit in the backseat no longer. As a matter of security, the United States adopted several satelite states to prevent the expansion of Soviet influence. And along the way, they developed a vast oil network that persisted for decades on decades</p>

        <h3>A New Age of Oil</h3>
        <p>The United States developed its oil network partially as a means of protection and security. However, as the U.S. became evermore the global power it is today, the need for such expansion for security became less and less a priority. This attitude of reduced expansion was only punctuated by the widespread practice of fracking, in which oil may be extracted on home/ally soil.</p>
        <p>As such, the need for foreign oil has decreased, and the United States has been closing itself off ever so slightly, as demonstrated in the graph above. The global implications of this "closure" is still unclear. However, there is no doubt that the United States' retraction from foreign regions oil-wise will have deep, lasting impacts on on the global scale. </p>
        <p>We may see a new age where the United States no longer needs the rest of the world-- a revival of American isolationism. It is unlikely that the U.S. will be closed off totally from the rest of the world. However, a change of the status quo is undeniable.</p>
