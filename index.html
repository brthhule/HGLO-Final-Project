            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <ul style = "text-align:left; font-size:larger">
                <li>For an estimated 190-226 million years, mosquitos have plagued the Earth</li>
                <li>During that time, they have killed 52 billion people via communicable diseases (such as Malaria)</li>
                <li>It is estimated that there have been 108 billion to ever live in human existence</li>
                <li>This means that mosquitos have killed close to half of all humans that have existed</li>
                <li>For most of human history, we have lived in fear of the mosquito and its deadly bites</li>
                <li>However, tides are changing as researchers develop genetic modification technologies to decrease the reproduction of malaria-carrying mosquitos</li>

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <ul style = "text-align:left;font-size:larger">
                <li>Access to oil is inherently tied to nations' securities-- More oil means that a nation can better defend itself</li>
                <li>For a long time, the most efficient way to get oil was to go to oil deposits (going to other countries and spending resources there)</li>
                <li>As such, during the Cold War, the U.S. expanded its oil network through satelite states</li>
                <li>The resulting network has resulted in a vast, global, interconnected oil market</li>
                <li>However, after the rise of fracking, the U.S. saw a decreased need to rely on foreign oil</li>
                <li>As such, we are entering a new age wherein the U.S. sources most of its oil internally</li>
